title: New Grad Software Job Hunting
---

I made a Reddit post about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/drq2na/i_applied_to_250_companies_for_entrylevel_jobs/">my experience job hunting</a> for software development roles last year (in 2019, looking to start in 2020), but nobody asked any detailed questions, so I wanted to write up a more in-depth analysis here but I forgot about it and ran out of time, so stay tuned...?
