        <p>Soon after starting my first job in June 2020, I signed <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">the Pledge</a> from <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>. It's basically a non-religious tithe to donate 10% of your lifetime income to effective charities, and as the end of the year approached, I had no idea where to donate.</p>
        
        <p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> made it easy by having a "Maximum Impact Fund" that already evaluates some very effective charities for us. All I had to do was <a href="https://www.givewell.org/about/donate/wire-transfer">send them a wire transfer</a>, which costs $25 per wire at my bank, Citibank. However, the best way to donate might be by via appreciated securities, a feature which Robinhood sadly does not offer. I'll update this page next year with what I decide then, but I definitely encourage all you rich young tech workers to take this pledge as well!</p>
