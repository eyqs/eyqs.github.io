        <h2>1. Invocation</h2>
        
        <q>Tell me, O goddess, of that fantastic hero, the fabled hero of fantasy, who fought alone through the nights, whose unshakable faith stood against all reason, when all humanity had fled and failed...</q>

Then I was back in my bed, watching myself inside the screen as the camera panned back to that monster, its claws slowly reaching towards the camera and now through the screen, the skin stretched taut over its face, slowly tearing open to reveal a grotesque―</p>
