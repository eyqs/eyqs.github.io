<h2>I Don't Think UBC Should Cancel All Classes for Coronavirus as I Want to Graduate</h2>

<h4>2020 March</h4>

<p>My stat mech prof Philip C. E. Stamp told me to write a blog post to "bring some sense to the administration", so I'm writing a blog post where I say that I don't think UBC should cancel all classes for coronavirus as I want to graduate.</p>


<h2>UBC Course Review: Computer Science and Computer Engineering</h2>

<h4>2020 February</h4>

<p>Engineering undergrads at the University of British Columbia don't get many electives. They only get to choose three of their <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,195,272,30">complementary studies courses</a>, one for impact of technology on society and two for humanities and social sciences. Different engineering programs differ on their number of technical electives, from ten in computer engineering to only two in chemical/biological engineering and mechatronics.</p>

<p>As an engineering physics student, I get five technical electives, but I've already used them all up. As I'll never get to actually take any more computer engineering/science courses for the last three years of my degree, now's the time to review all such courses I've actually taken. Also, I finally get to brag about my grades.</p>

<h4>2020 January</h4>

<p>Once upon a time, I had a blog.</p>

<p>It was in the opening days of my final year of elementary school, on a date very much like "2020/02/02", when for reasons lost to the winds of time I registered that WordPress.com subdomain, for I immediately began to write, spread uniformly over the next six months, approximately zero posts whatsoever. It was only in the opening days of the new decade, on a date very much like "2020/01/31", when I published its first post, with an apt and witty title very much like "First Post", expressing exactly the same sentiment, with roughly the same substance, but in 2% the word count. It took until mid-February, in the opening days of the Vancouver Winter Olympics, for the appearance of the second post, deceptively titled "Real First Post"; however, thenceforth, I published a post a day, every single day, for the next three years.</p>
