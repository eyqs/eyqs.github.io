      <h2>How to Give Well, by Giving What We Can</h2>
      
      <h4>2021 January</h4>
      
      <p>Soon after starting my first job in June 2020, I signed <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">the Pledge</a> from <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>. It's basically a non-religious tithe to donate 10% of your lifetime income to effective charities, and as the end of the year approached, I had no idea where to donate.</p>
      
      <p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> made it easy by having a "Maximum Impact Fund" that already evaluates some very effective charities for us. All I had to do was <a href="https://www.givewell.org/about/donate/wire-transfer">send them a wire transfer</a>, which costs $25 per wire at my bank, Citibank. However, the best way to donate might be by via appreciated securities, a feature which Robinhood sadly does not offer. I'll update this page next year with what I decide then, but I definitely encourage all you rich young tech workers to take this pledge as well!</p>

      <p>The lack of history courses is ultimately why I couldn't graduate with a minor in music ):</p>

      <h2>The Last Trump</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 November</h4>
      
      <p>In August 2019, Sarah Jones made <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/heres-how-wed-really-know-that-trump-is-the-antichrist.html">several interest predictions</a> about the future of America, mostly tongue-in-cheek:</p>
      
      <q>It’s not too late to convert. Or you could take the more exciting route, and refuse because you want to see what the Tribulation is like. I wouldn’t blame you! There will be locusts and plagues and rivers of blood. The Four Horseman will be there, and so will the Whore of Babylon. The Antichrist is going to behead a ton of people. Wormwood will fall into the sea and turn a third of the waters bitter. In other words, party time.</q>
      
      <p>Well, the locusts came. The plague came, and the rivers of blood. Heads were fired, and party time it was on election night 2020. Benjamin L. Corey had <a href="https://www.benjaminlcorey.com/could-american-evangelicals-spot-the-antichrist-heres-the-biblical-predictions/">even more specific interpretations</a> as 2020 progressed. And now I will make a prediction, that Trump will reign supreme over the United States for three more years, and at the end of his seven-year term, the first trumpet will sound.</p>

      <h2>UBC Course Reviews: Physics</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 October</h4>
      
      <p>This post should probably be split into two posts, one for the physics courses proper and one for the (sometimes more applied) labs. I'll keep it them in one post for now since there's no content anyways.</p>

      <h2>New Grad Software Job Hunting</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 September</h4>
      
      
      <p>I made a Reddit post about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/drq2na/i_applied_to_250_companies_for_entrylevel_jobs/">my experience job hunting</a> for software development roles last year (in 2019, looking to start in 2020), but nobody asked any detailed questions, so I wanted to write up a more in-depth analysis here but I forgot about it and ran out of time, so stay tuned...?</p>

      <h2>120,000 Egyptians Did Not Die Building the Suez Canal</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 July</h4>
      
      <p>If you ask Google, "how many people died building the Suez Canal", out pops the number from the Featured Snippet in giant 32px font, 120,000 deaths, a number so huge and devastating that only until June was it overtaken by the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States.</p>
      
      <p>It's quantitative, authoritative, and utterly bullshit. Have some perspective: the Suez Canal was so successful and profitable that its developer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Lesseps">Ferdinand de Lesseps</a>, immediately went on to build the Panama Canal, snaking through dense jungle infested with yellow fever and malaria, a project so disastrous that the company went bankrupt, the French government collapsed, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_scandals">a billion francs</a> (in 1889!) disappeared. The Panamal Canal disaster took 22,000 lives&mdash;so how exactly was the Suez Canal so successful if supposedly six times as many died?!</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, the only person with half a brain to answer <a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/43203">was mobbed by zombies without any</a>, so it'll take a while to get to the bottom of this. It's a modern tale as old as time, nationalist authoritarian president meets collection of books written thousands of years ago in ancient Greek, with a pinch of fake news to taste...</p>

      <h2>Coronavirus Update, May 8th</h2>

      <h4>2020 May</h4>
      
      <q>Tell me, O goddess, of that fantastic hero, the fabled hero of fantasy, who fought alone through the nights, whose unshakable faith stood against all reason, when all humanity had fled and failed...</q>
      
      <p>Yet another generic fantasyscape filled with oversaturated blues and greens. On a grassy knoll dotted with perfect cherry blossoms, now in the middle of a bustling temple amidst crowds of onlookers, now in a rocky outcrop overlooking the windy desert, the scenery morphed and flashed around my eyes.</p>

      <h2>Translation Party: JAPN 100 Edition</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 March</h4>
      
      <p>Junior high is a formative time, a transitory stage in one's social development when, despite what pubertal tendencies to reject and repudiate all authority and advice from one's elders, enough of that childlike reverence for the hallowed institutions of learning and their earthly representatives remains to sincerely take one or two lessons to heart. From social studies, "Wikipedia is not a reliable source." From English, MLA style. From science, the uselessness of flashcards―until a week ago, when I discovered the free-ish spaced-repetition flashcard app <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. And from French, the incommensurability of eighth-grade traduction and machine translation.</p>

      <h2>UBC Course Reviews: Computer Science and Computer Engineering</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 February</h4>
      
      <p>Engineering undergrads at the University of British Columbia don't get many electives. They only get to choose three of their <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,195,272,30">complementary studies courses</a>, one for impact of technology on society and two for humanities and social sciences. Different engineering programs differ on their number of technical electives, from ten in computer engineering to only two in chemical/biological engineering and mechatronics.</p>
      
      <p>As an engineering physics student, I get five technical electives, but I've already used them all up. As I'll never get to actually take any more computer engineering/science courses for the last three years of my degree, now's the time to review all such courses I've actually taken. Also, I finally get to brag about my grades.</p>

      <h2>First Post</h2>
      
      <h4>2020 January</h4>
      
      <p>Once upon a time, I had a blog.</p>
      
      <p>It was in the opening days of my final year of elementary school, on a date very much like "2020/02/02", when for reasons lost to the winds of time I registered that WordPress.com subdomain, for I immediately began to write, spread uniformly over the next six months, approximately zero posts whatsoever. It was only in the opening days of the new decade, on a date very much like "2020/01/31", when I published its first post, with an apt and witty title very much like "First Post", expressing exactly the same sentiment, with roughly the same substance, but in 2% the word count. It took until mid-February, in the opening days of the Vancouver Winter Olympics, for the appearance of the second post, deceptively titled "Real First Post"; however, thenceforth, I published a post a day, every single day, for the next three years.</p>
