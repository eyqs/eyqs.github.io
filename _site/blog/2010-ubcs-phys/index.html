          <h1>UBC Course Reviews: Physics</h1>
          <h3>2020 October</h3>
        </header>

        <p>This post should probably be split into two posts, one for the physics courses proper and one for the (sometimes more applied) labs. I'll keep it them in one post for now since there's no content anyways.</p>
