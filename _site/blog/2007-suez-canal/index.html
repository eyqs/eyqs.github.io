          <h3>2020 July</h3>

        <p>If you ask Google, "how many people died building the Suez Canal", out pops the number from the Featured Snippet in giant 32px font, 120,000 deaths, a number so huge and devastating that only until June was it overtaken by the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States.</p>
        
        <p>It's quantitative, authoritative, and utterly bullshit. Have some perspective: the Suez Canal was so successful and profitable that its developer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Lesseps">Ferdinand de Lesseps</a>, immediately went on to build the Panama Canal, snaking through dense jungle infested with yellow fever and malaria, a project so disastrous that the company went bankrupt, the French government collapsed, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_scandals">a billion francs</a> (in 1889!) disappeared. The Panamal Canal disaster took 22,000 lives&mdash;so how exactly was the Suez Canal so successful if supposedly six times as many died?!</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the only person with half a brain to answer <a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/43203">was mobbed by zombies without any</a>, so it'll take a while to get to the bottom of this. It's a modern tale as old as time, nationalist authoritarian president meets collection of books written thousands of years ago in ancient Greek, with a pinch of fake news to taste...</p>
