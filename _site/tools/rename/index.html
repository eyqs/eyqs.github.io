      <p>This tool lets you rename your GitHub default branches to whatever you want.</p>
      <p>Create a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">GitHub personal access token</a> with the <strong>repo</strong> scope, fill out the fields, but don't check the box unless you <strong>know</strong> those branches are safe to delete!</p>
      <p>When you submit the form, this <a href="https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/rename.js">short JavaScript snippet</a> is run, entirely on your local machine, making no network requests to any servers besides through the GitHub API. If you don't trust sketchy webapps despite the countless perfectly legitimate testimonials, please copy the JavaScript code and run it yourself.</p>

      <h2 class="space">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="question">What's a default branch?</p>
          <p class="answer">It's the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch">base branch in a GitHub repository</a>, which by default is <code>master</code>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Why should I use this tool?</p>
          <p class="answer">Freedom of speech! Defy conventions! Express yourself in one word!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Who, other than suspicious testimonials, would trust this site?</p>
          <p class="answer">Nobody. So you should really read <a href="https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/rename.js">the source code</a> and run it yourself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Will I encounter issues if branches with the same name already exist, or if there are many external hyperlinks to the <code>master</code> branch, or if many people use my repo as a submodule, or if I have many forks I don't want to touch, or if I have over 1239 repositories, or if I'm using multiple remotes, or if I'm using Netscape Navigator 3.02?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. In any case, <strong>don't use this tool.</strong> Nevertheless, feel free to modify it to suit your needs!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Would any changes be irreversible?</p>
          <p class="answer">Not unless you check the box to delete your old default branches. Usually, you can just run the script again in reverse to undo your changes. Otherwise, if you're not a casual user (see above), this tool isn't for you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Whose repositories does this affect?</p>
          <p class="answer">This script only affects repos under your username, unfortunately <strong>including all forks</strong>. It does not affect any repos owned by organizations, even if you are an owner of such a repo, because presumably you should probably consult your collaborators first before breaking everything.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Which scopes should I select when creating my token?</p>
          <p class="answer">You should select <strong>repo</strong> if you want to change both public and private repos, or just <strong>public_repo</strong> if you don't trust that I wouldn't "accidentally" delete all your private repos. Remember to revoke your token afterwards!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Where's the progress indicator?</p>
          <p class="answer">You can <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337">open up the JavaScript console</a> to see some output. A list of results for all repositories will show up at the very end, so be patient.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Whatever shall I do, in order to switch to my new branch on my local repositories after running this script?</p>
          <p class="answer">If you're scared of Git, you can do the usual: delete and clone again.</p>
          <p>If your local branch is behind or even with your remote branch, try:</p>
          <pre>
git pull
git checkout &lt;new_branch&gt;
git branch -d &lt;old_branch&gt;
git remote update -p
          </pre>
          <p>If your local branch is ahead of your remote branch, try:</p>
          <pre>
git checkout -b &lt;new_branch&gt;
git branch -d &lt;old_branch&gt;
git push &lt;remote&gt; -u &lt;new_branch&gt;
git remote update -p
          </pre>
          <p>Here's an example of the bash loop that I used:</p>
          <pre>
for d in ./*/; do (
  cd "$d" &&
  git pull &&
  git checkout salad &&
  git branch -d master &&
  git remote update -p
) done
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Whom should I ask for help in configuring <code>git init</code> to initialize new repositories with a different default branch?</p>
          <p class="answer">See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50880622">this StackOverflow answer by nicoo</a> for details.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">When will you write a script to rename GitLab default branches?</p>
          <p class="answer">Tomorrow, if this gets over 10 upvotes on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23563950">Hacker News</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/github/comments/hbit51/">Reddit</a>. Otherwise never, because nobody would ever use it, not even myself. [<strong>Update:</strong> I got four upvotes on both Hacker News and Reddit, so <strong>never</strong>. Reddit and the eight people who downvoted this must hate free speech!]</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Was this script thoroughly checked for bugs?</p>
          <p class="answer">No. I express no representation or warranties of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, all of which I hereby disclaim to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Whoever could have "accidentally" deleted all of my repos?</p>
          <p class="answer">It wasn't me! Again, please read <a href="https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/rename.js">the source code</a> to double-check.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Were any of these "frequently" asked questions ever asked?</p>
          <p class="answer">No.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
